    <p>The term irregular period consists of the both early and delayed menstrual cycles. Also, there is a difference between irregularities in the menstrual cycles of young women and women.
        In young women whose periods has just started or had started one to three years ago, the irregularity is either too close (duration of approx. 21 days between two periods) or too far(duration of approx. 45 days between two periods).
        Whereas in the case of adult women whose period had started three or 3+ years ago, the irregularity is either too close (duration of approx. 21 days between two periods) or too far(duration of approx. 35 days between two periods).
        Let's have a look at our main topic which is why periods are irregular. So there are some points mentioned below, these points look common but affect the menstrual cycle.
        1]Sleep Cycle:
        Having an unhealthy sleep cycle and poor sleep quality leads to an increase in cortisol hormone(which stays the body awake) and this leads to a decrease in leptin hormone(which is released for balancing energy levels in the body), these delays the ovulation period and hence irregularity in the menstrual cycle. 
        2]Stress:
        As mentioned above cortisol hormone is at its peak,when we are stressed. But, the level of cortisol hormone should be more early morning and less at night or midnight. So this hormone disturbs the balance of progesterone-estrogen hormones which leads to irregular periods. 
        
        3]Medicines:
        In many young women, the continued or over-use of birth control pills also highly affects irregularity and disturbs the hormonal harmony of the body. 
        
        4]Weight changes:
        Suddenly gaining or losing weight,  following a strict diet or eating unhealthy food causes irregularity.</p>
